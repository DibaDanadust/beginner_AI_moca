# beginner_AI_moca
With this code, I am trying to help people who are just starting to learn not to be afraid of reading and writing codes and importing libraries and to easily communicate with Python.(knowing the Python 3 libraries is very helpful)
def simple_AI():

     print ("Moca: Hi, I'm Moca. How can I assist you today?")

while True:
user input = input ("You: ")
if user_input.lower() == "hello":
print ("Moca: Hello there!")
elif user_input.lower() == "how are
you":
print ("Moca: I'm functioning
well!")
elif user_input. lower () == "bye":
print Moca: Goodbye! Have a
great day.")
break else:
print ("Moca: I'm not sure how to
respond to that. Can you ask something else?")
